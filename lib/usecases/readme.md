This folder contains the usecases and services that connect the data layer with the presentation.
The input of the users are passed from the presentation layer (if needed) to these usecases/services
which are then performing the corresponding action in the data layer and receive data and give it
back to the presentation layer to display.
(This might seem a bit useless)
not that important yet

NOTE: This folder can be extended with entity and repository prototypes
